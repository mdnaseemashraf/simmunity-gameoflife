# simmunity-gameoflife
An implementation of Conway's Game of Life to showcase the Immune System.

## Background
This program implements a variant of Conway's Game of Life invented by John Horton Conway. You can read more about it [on it's Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).
More on [Cellular automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton). More on my [blog](https://mdnaseemashraf.wordpress.com/2013/06/30/simmunity-a-new-game-of-life/).

The simulation is generated as a CSV text file by a Java program for a variant of Game of Life. This simulation CSV file is the processed by
a MATLAB program to produce a step by step animation.

Note: Pathogen, [Phagocyte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phagocyte), Virus, Infection are all used interchangibly from here onwards.

## Rules of Simmunity: A New Game of Life

    Regeneration Step:
    10% RBC (Red Blood Cells) are regenerated in a random fashion in empty places (i.e occupied by Blood-Plasma) after every step.

    Regeneration Step:
    10% WBC (White Blood Cells) are regenerated in a random fashion in empty places (i.e occupied by Blood-Plasma) after every step.

    Pathogen Spread Step:
    Pathogen (denoted by black in the graphics grid) eats and replaces (i.e.copies itself in) any one of the 8 neighboring adjacent
    cell if populated by an RBC.

    WBC Spread Step:
    WBC eats and replaces (i.e.copies itself in) any one of the 8 neighboring adjacent cell if populated by Pathogen.

    Starvation Death Step:
    When a Pathogen cell is not surrounded by any RBC for more than three steps/iterations the Pathogen dies to leave Plasma (empty
    cell) behind.

    Starvation Death Step:
    When a WBC is not surrounded by any Pathogen cell for more than three steps/iterations the WBC dies to leave Plasma (empty cell)
    behind.

    Natural Death Step:
    A RBC dies after a few iterations simulating natural death of RBCs.

## Aim
This project showcases that the application of simple rules onto a universe with diverse random elements can yield interesting patterns that exhibit intelligent processes as a net result of each relationship rule. The project shows the fight of Virus (here Phagocytes) and White Blood Cells in the blood stream, where RBC is the primary source of food for Virus and there exists the water content or blood plasma in emty spaces of the universe.

The universe is shown as a cellular matrix and the changes to the system by individual rule application is also represented as a graphical grid display in Matlab.

### Outcomes
    1. The body/system/universe heals successfully or fights off the disease/infection and no pathogen is left in the system. The WBC and RBC attain maximum levels flooding the universe and then attain an equilibrium of death and regeneration.

    2. The body/system/universe succumbs to the disease and the pathogen spreads to dominate the universe for the stipulated number of iterations. Note: The body/system/universe will recover in later steps when the pathogen starts dying out of starvation and regenerating WBC will strike back with a vengeance. Also the RBC count will increase by regenration.

    3. The fight is still going on and the stipulated number of steps by the user has to be increased.

## Working Mechanism

    1) The Java Simmunity program takes in the dimensions of the universe matrix from the user and
    the number of steps to be simulated in it.

    2) It then populates the matrix with WBC, RBC, Plasma and Virus as per predefined percentages 
    and randomness, originally coded in the java algorithm.

    3) The subsequent steps are print in a CSV format to an output text file for portability. Also,
    a step by step statistic record is also made in a CSV text file.

    4) The output CSV is then processed by the Matlab program to be animated into a graphic grid and
    each step is animated to display the course of the simulation.

    5) The statistic records can be read into the visualization matlab programs to show the simulated
    animation as plots and graphs.

### Assisting Files
    unittests.m = Used for statistic data visualization.
    CellSimulation.m = Used for grid animation.

## Program Setup

You need to create a Directory called SIMMUNITY on the Desktop with two sub-directories, Outputs and Universes Collection.

The Outputs sub-directory will contain FirstStat.txt and SimData.txt files auto-generated by the Java AI program. These contain a CSV matrix for processing by Matlab M-Files. 

The Universes Collection sub-directory will contain a Random Universe.txt file that will contain the size of the simulated cellular universe (i.e the grid or matrix) for the Matlab M-Files to run loops accordingly and create a simulation. You do not need to create these text files.

Note: Feel free to alter the workflow adn file dependencies as you see fit. I actually, recommend it to set it up as convienently as possible on your workspace.
